Implement bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

Modify the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of strings in ascending order.

Write a function to sort an array of objects based on a specific property. For example, given an array of student objects with properties like name, age, and grade, sort the array based on the grade property in ascending order.

Implement a modified bubble sort algorithm that stops sorting if the array is already sorted.

Compare the time complexity of bubble sort with other sorting algorithms like quicksort and mergesort.
