Data Structures and Algorithms are the backbone of computer science and programming. DSA provides a way to store and manipulate data effectively, and algorithms provide efficient solutions to problems that can be solved through computer programs. In this GitHub repository, we will explore different data structures and algorithms that are essential for any software developer or computer scientist to know.

Data Structures:
This section of the repository will cover the different data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. We will discuss how each of these data structures works, and their pros and cons in different scenarios. We will also implement these data structures in various programming languages and explore their applications through sample code snippets.

Algorithms:
This section of the repository will focus on different algorithms, including searching and sorting algorithms, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and divide and conquer algorithms. We will implement these algorithms in various programming languages, discuss their complexity, and explain how they can be used to solve real-world problems.

Interview Preparation:
This section of the repository will be specifically aimed at individuals preparing for technical interviews for jobs or internships. We will discuss common data structures and algorithms that are often asked in technical interviews and provide sample questions to practice. We will also provide tips and tricks for tackling these types of questions and strategies to help you ace your interview.

Contributing:
This GitHub repository is open for contributions from anyone interested in Data Structures and Algorithms. If you have any knowledge, experience, or code snippets that you would like to share with the community, feel free to contribute to the repository.
